                Now, on to some FAQ's about this site, and myself.
            </p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Who am I?</dt>
                <dd>I am FenixTek. At least, in the online world, anyway.</dd>
                <dt>What do I do?</dt>
                <dd>That's complicated... I am a software developer and technology enthusiast. If you want to know more, read on.</dd>
                <dt>Did you make this website from scratch?</dt>
                <dd>I did, yes!</dd>
                <dt>It's a bit ugly!</dt>
                <dd>That's not a question... But yes, you're right. Originally, I only used one style sheet, which is now "darkmode". (You can click the button in the top right to change it.) But to make light and dark modes distinct, I just made the colours as opposite as I could.</dd>
                <dt>So... you're a web developer?</dt>
                <dd>Sort of... I actually went to college and studied "Digital Industries" at Level 3. I then went on to study "Computer Games (Software Development) at Uni. Due to the lack of game develoer jobs in my area, I decided to broaden my horizons.</dd>
                <dt>So... you're a game developer?</dt>
                <dd>Again, sort of. I can do a lot when it comes to making games, however, I have never worked for a "proper" studio. I have, however, worked on two published games. One on itch.io, and another on both itch.io and Steam.</dd>
                <dt>Why do some pages take me straight to the "login" page?</dt>
                <dd>Because... well... as easy as it is to just make up a fake email address and look at my info, I figured it would be a little added layer of security to put off bots and stuff... TO view said pages, sign up or sign in, and they should appear for you!</dd>
