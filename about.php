                Now, on to some FAQ's about this site, and myself.
            </p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Who are you?</dt>
                <dd>I am Adam.</dd>
                <dt>So, who or what is "FenixTek"?</dt>
                <dd>It's a few things... first and foremost, it's the working name of the software/tech company I was considering starting.</dd>
                <dt>What do you do?</dt>
                <dd>That's complicated... I am a software developer and technology enthusiast. If you want to know more, read on.</dd>
                <dt>Did you make this website from scratch?</dt>
                <dd>I did, yes!</dd>
                <dt>It's a bit ugly!</dt>
                <dd>That's not a question... But yes, you're right. Originally, I only used one style sheet, which is now "darkmode". (You can click the button in the top right to change it.) But to make light and dark modes distinct, I just made the colours as opposite as I could.</dd>
                <dt>So... you're a web developer?</dt>
                <dd>Sort of... I actually went to college and studied "Digital Industries" at Level 3. I then went on to study "Computer Games (Software Development) at Uni. Due to the lack of game develoer jobs in my area, I decided to broaden my horizons.</dd>
                <dt>So... you're a game developer?</dt>
                <dd>Again, sort of. I can do a lot when it comes to making games, however, I have never worked for a "proper" studio. I have, however, worked on two published games. One on itch.io, and another on both itch.io and Steam.</dd>
